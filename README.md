## 🔐 DevSecOps Pipeline for a Python Flask Application

### 📌 **Project Description**

This project implements a robust **DevSecOps pipeline** for a Python Flask-based web application, integrating modern security tools and CI/CD best practices. The main goal is to automate security scanning at every phase of the development lifecycle — ensuring code quality, infrastructure compliance, and container image safety — all before deployment.

The project uses **GitLab CI/CD** as the orchestration engine while leveraging code stored in **GitHub**. It performs static code analysis (SAST), software composition analysis (SCA), container vulnerability scanning, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) validation using the following tools:

### 🧰 **Key Features**

* **Automated CI/CD pipeline** using GitLab CI
* **Static Application Security Testing** via SonarCloud
* **Software Composition Analysis** with Snyk (requirements.txt, Docker)
* **Container Image Vulnerability Scanning** using Trivy
* **Infrastructure-as-Code Analysis** using Checkov on Terraform and Dockerfiles
* **Environment-specific configuration** via GitLab CI/CD variables
* Secure token management for SonarCloud, Snyk, and GitHub API
* Optional daily scheduled scans to catch new vulnerabilities

---

### 🚀 **Pipeline Workflow Overview**

1. **Build** the Flask application and set up environment
2. **Run SAST** with SonarCloud to detect insecure coding patterns
3. **Run SCA** using Snyk to detect vulnerable dependencies
4. **Container Scan** using Trivy to scan the built Docker image
5. **IaC Scan** with Checkov to validate Terraform and Docker security
6. **Publish reports** (optional) to dashboards or notify via email/slack

### 🎯 **Objective**

To integrate security at every stage of the software delivery pipeline — ensuring early detection of vulnerabilities, reducing remediation time, and establishing a security-first development culture.
