This project implements a robust DevSecOps pipeline for a Python Flask-based web application, integrating modern security tools and CI/CD best practices. The main goal is to automate security scanning at every phase of the development lifecycle — ensuring code quality, infrastructure compliance, and container image safety — all before deployment.
